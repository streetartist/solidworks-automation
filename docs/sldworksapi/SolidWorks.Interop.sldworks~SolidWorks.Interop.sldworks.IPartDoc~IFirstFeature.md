Remarks

This method returns features in the current order for the part, and this order changes when the part is edited.

Your application should not assume that:

- features retain the same relative or absolute position throughout the part’s lifetime. For example, you should not assume that Sketch1 always appears before Sketch2.
- any feature has a specific name. Because features can be renamed, you cannot assume that the first reference plane feature is named Plane1.

When traversing the FeatureManager design tree, your application should use [IFeature::GetTypeName2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetTypeName2.md) and [IFeature::GetSpecificFeature2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetSpecificFeature2.md) to identify specific features instead of relying solely on [IFeature::Name](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~Name.md).

This method returns features in the model definition order, which is not the same as the order displayed in the user interface. See [ITreeControlItem](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ITreeControlItem.md) for details.

If a feature is suppressed, then this method can still access the feature.

To access the next feature in the FeatureManager design tree and subfeatures, use [IFeature::GetNextFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetNextFeature.md) or [IFeature::IGetNextFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetNextFeature.md) and [IFeature::GetFirstSubFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetNextSubFeature.md) or [IFeature::IGetFirstSubFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetNextSubFeature.md).
