Remarks

[IRefPlaneFeatureData::AccessSelections](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~AccessSelections.md) and [IRefPlaneFeatureData::IAccessSelections](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~IAccessSelections.md) put the model in a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define the feature.

Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature, or use [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.md) or [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.md) if you did modify the feature.

**IMPORTANT:** Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the **Remarks** section in the [IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.md) topic for details about reference planes and this interface.

Requirements

**Target Platforms:** Windows 7, Windows Vista SP1 or later, Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2008 (Server Core not supported), Windows Server 2008 R2 (Server Core supported with SP1 or later), Windows Server 2003 SP2
