#### Parameters

*Count*
:   Number of selected entities to use to create this reference plane

See [In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm) for details about this type of method.

Remarks

Call [IRefPlaneFeatureData::GetSelectionsCount](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~GetSelectionsCount.md) to get the value for Count.

See [Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm) for additional details on using this method.

**IMPORTANT:** Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the **Remarks** section in the [IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.md) topic for details about reference planes and this interface.

Requirements

**Target Platforms:** Windows 7, Windows Vista SP1 or later, Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2008 (Server Core not supported), Windows Server 2008 R2 (Server Core supported with SP1 or later), Windows Server 2003 SP2
