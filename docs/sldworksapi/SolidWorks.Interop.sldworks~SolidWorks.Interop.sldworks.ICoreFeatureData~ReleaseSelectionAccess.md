Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature or use [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.md) or [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.md) if you did.
