Remarks

| --- | --- |
| **To modify a feature in a...** | **Then...** |
| Part | - TopDoc argument is the [IModelDoc2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2.md) for the part - Component argument is Nothing or null |
| Assembly | - TopDoc is the IModelDoc2 object for the assembly - Component argument is the [IComponent2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2.md) object in which the feature is to be modified |

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.md) or [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.md) if you modified the feature
- [IPartingLineFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPartingLineFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.md) if you did not
