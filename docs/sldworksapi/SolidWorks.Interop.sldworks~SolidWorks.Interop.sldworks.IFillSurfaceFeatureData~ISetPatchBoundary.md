Function ISetPatchBoundary( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer, _
   ByRef DispArr As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

```

Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim DispArr As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean
 
value = instance.ISetPatchBoundary(Count, DispArr)
```

```

   System.int Count,
   ref System.object DispArr
)

#### Parameters

*Count*
:   Number of entities to use for the patch boundary

*DispArr*
:   - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of entities to use as the patch boundary of size count; valid entities are:
      - [edges](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.md)
      - [sketches](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketch.md)
    - VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

    See [In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm) for details about this type of method.

#### Return Value

True if the patch boundary is set, false if not

Remarks

See [Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm) for additional details on using this method.

Requirements

**Target Platforms:** Windows 7, Windows Vista SP1 or later, Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2008 (Server Core not supported), Windows Server 2008 R2 (Server Core supported with SP1 or later), Windows Server 2003 SP2
