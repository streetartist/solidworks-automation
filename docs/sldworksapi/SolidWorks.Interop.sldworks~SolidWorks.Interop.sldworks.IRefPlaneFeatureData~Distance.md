Remarks

**IMPORTANT:** Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the **Remarks** section in the [IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.md) topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
