```

Function GetLoopCount() As System.Integer
```

```

Dim instance As IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer
 
value = instance.GetLoopCount()
```

```

#### Return Value

Number of loops for the patches

Remarks

Call this method before calling [IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData::IGetEdges](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData~IGetEdges.md) to get the size of the array for that method.

Example

See [IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData.md) examples.
